# Password Generator

## Usage
As companies grow in size, their assets become more and more important. This requires the companies to become more secure, in turn needing a password system. With this password generator, a company can create a password that ranges in size from 8 characters to 128 characters. Each password contains at least 1 lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter, a number, and a symbol, creating a very unique password for the user.

## Installation
This site includes an HTML, CSS, and Javascript file. Using the HTML file, I created several divs to house each aspect of the site, and used the CSS file to style it. Using the Javascript, I was able to give the buttons functions to create the random password and copy it to the computer's clipboard. I was also able to program the site to list past generated passwords. To add some style to the page, I added a background image in the CSS.
